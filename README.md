# Git Branches

A branch lets you split from the main line of development. The new branch shares a part of its commit history with the main branch. At a certain commit the new branch branches off and the commit histories differ.

1. create a new feature branch and work on that new branch.

2. commit your work on the new branch - the main branch is not effected.

3. finish work on the new feature, test the new functionality and have other developers review your work.

4. merge your feature branch into the main branch, so all your work is included in the main branch.
